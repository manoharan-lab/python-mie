# Data from Yang, Applied Optics 2003, Table 3, cases 2-4. 
# We use Q_ext, Q_sca, and Q_back only.
# The value for Q_back for case 2 has been changed to the value obtained
# by increasing the order n from which 0-based down recurrence for the logarithmic
# derivative Dn1 begins. (Now computed using Lentz continued fraction method.)
